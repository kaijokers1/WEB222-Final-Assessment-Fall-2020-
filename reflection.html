        <strong> Reflection Paper</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="REFLECTION">In the Final Assessment, I have built an online store. In the first part (Assignment 5), i built a normal web with only show our product and information of the shop. 
          The next one we must improve my web page by add more a web page for customer write feedback and subscribe(contact.html). In this page I used some HTML Forms
          . As you know a HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing. 
          Firstly, I form the email address by using https://formspree.io/f/xjvpaknw to receive the email customer. The second one, I made the form for customer's feedback, in here customers are required to write full information by instruction.  By “required” syntax for every row, the client have to fill all the blank, after that they can submit the feedback.  Next, I use” pattern” for address and the phone number. In this way I ask the customer to write the correct address, postal code, and telephone number according to the form I provided. In addition, I also give suggestions by place holder command for customers to easily follow to complete their feedback.
        Lucky for me, when I debugged this form, it already worked without error. Because I followed step by step in the lecture of my professor, it makes me easy to understand and do the form.
        After this work, I learned that we have 3 things to know when we want to build a form. The first is the components of forms and form structure. Second, input fields what enable users to fill in a form, and finally, order the form logically. Those what I learned as well as an advice for any developer to build a form.
